For the most part, these designs are self-limiting, but they can pose problems in comparison to better-balanced heroes. A disparity of more than 50% between a pair of power level limited traits is something to look at closely before approving."

										"{@b Doing Good}: Some heroes fight the good fight simply because it’s the right thing to do and they believe in doing the right thing no matter what. Their strong moral center may come from a good upbringing (or a bad one that showed them what not to do) or the guidance or inspiration of a mentor or idol.",
										"{@b Greed}: There are those motivated by nothing more than the opportunity to make a profit off their heroic careers. They may be mercenaries for hire or marketing machines who do good deeds but also rake in the proceeds from licensing fees and public appearances. More altruistic heroes tend to look down upon their profit-mongering peers.",
										"{@b Justice}: An overwhelming thirst for justice drives some heroes, a need to see the innocent protected and the guilty punished, even if they are beyond the reach of the law. These heroes walk a thin line. For some justice becomes a thirst for vengeance for injury done to the hero in the past, like the death of a loved one.",
										"{@b Patriotism}: Heroes are often devoted to the ideals of their home (or adopted) nation, and seek to serve that nation and its people with their abilities. Patriotic heroes are often honored as champions of their homelands, but it is the service, and not necessarily the recognition, that matters.",
										"{@b Recognition}: Some heroes just want recognition or attention, and dressing up in a bright costume and fighting crime is one surefire way to get people to notice you. The hero may be a shy nobody out of costume or a glory-hog who loves the spotlight.",
										"{@b Responsibility}: The responsibility of having great power can be a heavy burden but some heroes feel it is their duty to use the powers they’ve been given for the greater good. Oftentimes these heroes are trying to live up to an ideal like a mentor or a predecessor who inspired them.",

Perhaps a stray blast damages a building or hurts an innocent bystander, your fire powers set off sprinkler systems, or you cause volatile chemicals to explode. A hero with this as a regular complication may be especially accident-prone, inexperienced with their powers, or even jinxed! The GM decides the effects of an accident, but they should be troublesome. Accidents can lead to further complications; perhaps the hero develops a guilt-complex, obsession, or phobia involving the accident.",
										"{@b Addiction}: You need something, whether for physical or psychological reasons. You’ll go out of your way to satisfy your addiction, and being unable to satisfy it may lead to other complications, either involving your own faculties or your relationships with people. Several comic book heroes have struggled with various addictions and the effects on their lives.",
										"{@b Disability}: You are limited by a particular disability, such as being blind, deaf, or paraplegic. When your disability places serious challenges in your path, your complication comes into play. Many “disabled” heroes have powers or other compensations for their disabilities, such as a blind hero with other enhanced senses or a paraplegic who is a powerful psychic with matchless mobility of mind over body. Even though their powers sometime make up for their disability, this complication is still appropriate because they may have to deal with it from time to time.",
										"{@b Enemy}: You have an enemy, or enemies, trying to do you harm. The GM can have your enemy show up to cause you trouble, and adventures involving your enemy tend to be more complicated for you; even personal grudge-matches, if the enmity goes both ways. When having an enemy causes a particular problem for you (such as your enemy abducting a loved one or laying a trap for you), you get a victory point.",
										"{@b Fame}: You’re a public figure, known almost everywhere you go, hounded by the media, swamped by fans and well-wishers, and similar problems, which create various complications.",
										"{@b Hatred}: You have an irrational hatred of something, leading you to actively oppose the object of your dislike in some way, no matter the consequences. Complications involving your hatred tend to overwhelm your better judgment.",
										"{@b Honor}: You have a strong personal code of honor. Generally this means you won’t take unfair advantage of opponents or use trickery, but you can define the exact terms of your code with the GM. Your honor becomes a complication when it puts you in a bind or on the horns of a moral dilemma.",
										"{@b Identity}: Heroes often maintain secret identities, creating various complications as they try to keep them secret from friends and enemies alike. The dual-identity can even go beyond mere disguise for heroes who actually transform into a different persona, creating complications around controlling that transformation, or a lack of powers or abilities in one persona.",
										"{@b Obsession}: You’re obsessed with a particular subject and pursue it to the exclusion of all else, which can create quite a few complications.",
										"{@b Phobia}: You’re irrationally afraid of something. When confronted with it you have to fight to control your fear, causing you to hesitate, flee, or act irrationally.",
										"{@b Power Loss}: Certain circumstances cause some or all of your powers to fail or stop working, or rob you of them altogether. You might depend on particular objects others can steal or take from you, or lose your powers during the dark of the moon, or when exposed to exotic radiation. You may even simply lose faith in yourself, resulting in temporary weakness. When this happens, and poses a challenge for you, your complication comes into play.",
										"{@b Prejudice}: You are part of a minority group subject to the prejudices of others, which create problems. Similarly, characters with unusual origins or appearance might face prejudice, such as a demonic-looking hero who is considered suspect. Some Gamemasters and gaming groups may prefer not to deal with issues of prejudice in their games, in which case the GM is free to ban this complication.",
										"{@b Quirk}: Complications can often come from various personality quirks: likes, dislikes, hobbies, neuroses, and so forth. For example, a hero might have the quirk of always leaving some sort of “calling card” for the authorities along with a captured criminal. That could become a complication if somebody else starts imitating it, or uses it to cause trouble for the hero.",
										"{@b Relationship}: The important people in a hero’s life are a source of strength, but they can also complicate matters considerably. If they are not in on the hero’s costumed identity, then there is juggling two lives and keeping loved ones safely in the dark. On the other hand, if the people in a hero’s life do know the truth, they are in danger from the hero’s foes and others seeking to find out.",
										"{@b Reputation}: You have a bad reputation, affecting what others think of you (whether you deserve it or not). Having someone adopt a bad attitude toward you because of your reputation is a complication. You might struggle to overcome your reputation, taking chances or facing difficulties others do not as a result.",
										"{@b Responsibility}: You have various demands on your time and attention. Responsibilities include family obligations, professional duties, and similar things. Failing to live up to your responsibilities can mean loss of relationships, employment, and other problems.",
										"{@b Rivalry}: You feel a strong sense of competition with a person or group and have to do your best to outdo your rival at every opportunity.",
										"{@b Secret}: You have something potentially damaging or embarrassing you’re hiding from the world. The most common secret for heroes is their true identity, but it could be a secret weakness (another complication) or some dark secret from your past. Occasionally, something (or someone) may threaten to reveal your secret.",
										"{@b Temper}: Certain things just set you off. When you lose your temper you lash out at whatever provoked you.",
										"{@b Weakness}: Some things can hurt you, badly. You might have a weakness that overcomes your normally strong defenses, like a werewolf is vulnerable to silver, or you may suffer harm from things that are harmless to others, from water to cold iron or exotic energies or materials. A weakness may add degrees of effect or impose an entirely different effect. Affliction (see {@b Powers}) is the typical effect, but some weaknesses inflict outright Damage, Weaken the target, or have some other effect. You and the GM can discuss common effects beforehand and it is up to the GM to decide what happens when the particular weakness comes into play. When the GM uses your weakness against you, it’s a complication."

Since there is only so much “screen time” in a game session, there is virtually no way for the GM to spotlight every one of every character’s disadvantages, so some end up being worth “more” in the sense of reward in exchange for drawbacks. Plus, after they have “paid out” their initial benefit, front-loaded negative traits are nothing but a burden to the character from that point forward, leading players to try and avoid or mitigate them as much as possible.",
								"Complications address this issue by having a “pay-as-you-go” approach: if the GM uses a complication in the game, and the player responds by going along with it, the player gets a reward in the form of a victory point.

The hero gains powers accidentally from exposure to some force like radiation, chemicals, unleashed mystic energies, being struck by lightning, and so forth. Accidents are often one-time events, although sometimes there is an effort to recreate an accident to deliberately make super-beings. The current science of the setting tends to influence accidental origins. Golden Age heroes in the 1940s often gained their powers from chemical accidents while Silver Age heroes in the Atomic Age of the ‘60s got their powers from radiation and modern heroes acquire powers from accidents involving genetic engineering, nanotech, and similar cutting-edge technologies.",
										"{@b Alien}: A hero may be a member of an alien race with unusual powers compared to humans. Either all members of the race have similar powers or particular conditions (lighter gravity, solar radiation, etc.) grant them powers while on Earth. Some “alien” races in the comics are actually super-human offshoots of humanity living isolated from the rest of the world. “Aliens” also include mystical beings from other dimensions, from angels and demons to elementals and actual gods, as well as mortal half-breeds descended from them. An alien hero’s powers might even have another origin; being an alien only explains part of the character’s powers or is merely a background element.",
										"{@b Endowment}: Some outside force grants the hero powers. This might be an experimental procedure, a godlike higher power, a secret organization that hands out powerful devices, a mysterious wizard, or something similar. The patron might expect something in return from the hero for this boon, or the gift could be unconditional.",
										"{@b Experiment}: Some heroes gain powers from a deliberate effort, such as a scientific or mystical technique for transforming someone into a super-being. Like accidents, experiments are often impossible to duplicate. The hero may be a willing volunteer or a victim chosen to test out the technique. Some heroes create their own powers, either developing the power-granting procedure or building their own devices.",
										"{@b Mutant}: A hero may simply be born “different,” with the genetic potential for super-powers. These latent powers typically emerge in a time of stress, especially the changes brought on by puberty, although they might also appear as a result of an accident (combining the accident and mutant origins).",
										"{@b Training}: Finally, some heroes acquire powers through hard work and training, whether physical discipline, studying esoteric martial arts techniques, meditation and introspection to unlock hidden mental powers, or mastering the arts of magic.

						"Generally, heroes each receive 1 Character point for a successfully completed adventure that lasts for one game session. If the heroes overcame especially powerful foes or difficult challenges, the GM can increase the Character point award to 2 points. For adventures lasting more than one game session, the heroes should get 1 Character point per session, plus a possible Character point at the end if they did particularly well.",
						"Gamemasters may vary the rate of advancement by awarding more Character points per adventure, allowing heroes to increase in power faster, which may suit certain styles of play. The Gamemaster also may choose not to award a Character point for an adventure in which the heroes did especially poorly, such as failing to defeat a villain’s major scheme or allowing many innocent people to suffer harm they could have prevented.",
						"Players can spend their heroes’ awarded Character points in-between adventures to improve the heroes’ traits, limited only by the series power level. They can also choose to save up unspent Character points, waiting until the power level increases, in order to spend them to improve a trait already at its maximum rating or rank. Players spend Character points on new or improved traits for their heroes just the same as spending them to create a hero. So if your hero has a power costing 2 points per rank, and you want to improve it by 1 rank, spend 2 of your earned Character points to do so.",

								"As heroes earn Character points through adventuring and spend them to improve their traits, they will eventually run into the limits imposed by the series power level (see {@b Power Level} for details). For a while, this can be a good thing, since the power level limits encourage heroes to diversify and acquire new skills, advantages, and powers rather than simply pumping points into their existing traits to increase them to unwieldy levels. However, sooner or later, you’re going to want to raise the power level, giving the heroes a bit more breathing room for advancement and spending their earned Character points.",
								"A good guideline is to follow the starting Character point totals when it comes to power level: when the heroes accumulate an additional 15 Character points from the start of the series or the last time the power level was raised, it’s probably time to raise the power level by +1. So a power level 10 game starts out with 150-point heroes. When they have earned another 15 Character points (bringing their total up to 165), the GM should consider raising the power level to 11, allowing the heroes to spend some of those Character points to increase traits which are currently at the maximum limit.",
								"When you increase the power level, you should also reevaluate the capabilities of the villains and other challenges the heroes face. While NPCs don’t earn additional Character points as such, and aren’t even subject to the same power level limits as the heroes, you should feel free to improve the traits of some non-player characters to keep pace with the heroes, ensuring those antagonists remain a suitable challenge. It’s also fine to have others lag behind, as the heroes outstrip some of their old foes, who no longer represent the kind of threat they did before, plus you can introduce new villains and challenges suited to the series power level as things progress."

It’s more interesting and clear to say a hero has a “Flame Blast” or “Lightning Bolt” power than a generic “Damage effect.” “Flame” and “lightning” are descriptors for the Damage effect. Descriptors do have some impact on the game since some effects work only on or with effects of a particular descriptor. A hero may be immune to fire and heat, for example, so any effect with the “fire” or “heat” descriptor doesn’t affect that character. The different sense types are descriptors pertaining to sensory effects.",
								"Generally speaking, a descriptor is part of what a power is called beyond its game system name. For example, a weather-controlling heroine has the following effects: Damage, Concealment, and Environment. Her Damage effect is the power to throw lightning bolts, so it has the descriptor “lightning.” If a villain can absorb electricity, then his power works against the heroine’s Damage (since lightning is electrical in nature). Concealment creates thick banks of fog, giving it the “fog” or “mist” descriptor. So if an opponent transforms into mist, with the ability to regenerate in clouds or fog, he can regenerate inside the heroine’s Concealment area. Her Environment is the power to control the weather, giving it the descriptor “weather.” If the heroine’s power comes as a gift from the gods, it may also have the descriptor “divine” or “magical.” On the other hand, if it comes from her mutant genetic structure, then it has the descriptor “mutant.” A villain able to nullify mutant powers could potentially nullify all of the heroine’s powers!",
								"The number of power descriptors is virtually limitless. The players and Gamemaster should cooperate to apply the appropriate descriptors to characters’ powers and use common sense when dealing with how the different descriptors interact. Just because one hero throws “lightning” and an opponent can absorb “electricity” doesn’t mean the villain’s absorption doesn’t work because it’s not the exact same descriptor. Lightning is a form of electricity. A certain amount of flexibility is built into descriptors, allowing them to cover the full range of possible powers. As in all things, the GM is the final arbitrator and should be consistent when ruling on whether or not a particular descriptor is appropriate and how all effects and descriptors interact in the series.",

The GM awards the player a victory point for the unexpected set-back and now the source of the heroine’s powers is known, although their origin still remains a mystery….",
										"Applying descriptors in play gives you a lot of flexibility, letting you handle certain things “on the fly” rather than having to describe every aspect of a character in excruciating detail beforehand. The key tool for handling the application of descriptors in play is the use of victory points. If applying a new descriptor is a setback for the hero, then award the player a victory point, just like any other setback (see {@b Complications}). If the new descriptor is chosen by the player and gives the hero a minor advantage, you might ask the player to pay a victory point for the privilege, although you can balance this with an immediate victory point award for the clever idea, if you want (making the victory point a token expenditure).

In the latter case you might want to call for a Technology skill check to make sure the character gets the terminals and the voltage right, but most of the time it’s better to just let the trick go through and give the character a chance to shine.",
										"Creative uses of descriptors with no real game effect are freebies: no extra effort or victory points needed. Situations where creative uses of descriptors have a significant game effect can be handled as power stunts: pick the effect that best suits the desired outcome and treat it as an Alternate Effect of the power the hero wants to use, with descriptors assigned as appropriate. If an electrical-controlling hero wants to use his power like a living defibrillator to save a heart-attack victim, for example, that can be a Healing power stunt.

										"On some occasions, you or a player may wish to change a particular descriptor during the course of the game, removing an existing descriptor and possibly replacing it with another one.",
										"Sometimes this takes the form of discovering that a descriptor the character thought applied actually does not, such as a hero discovering his “magical” powers are actually the mutant ability to manipulate reality in certain ways. So long as the change doesn’t contradict any previously introduced information, this is no different than applying a descriptor in play, and should be handled in the same way. On the other hand, if other effects previously worked on the hero as if his powers were magical, then some sort of explanation is required. The Gamemaster may wish to limit or ban “discovering” a descriptor that has already been established, although it might still be changed.",
										"Changing descriptors is best handled as a plot device, much like reallocating character points and redesigning characters. If exposure to strange magical forces changes a character’s power source from biological to magical, for example, that’s something for the GM to decide in the context of the game. Like with defining descriptors in play, if a change in descriptors through GM Fiat constitutes a setback, the GM should award the player a victory point. Changes that provide an advantage don’t cost a victory point, however, since the GM chooses when and where they occur.",
										"Temporarily changing a descriptor can be a use of extra effort, like any other power stunt. For example, a hero might change the result of an electrical Damage effect to a magnetic Move Object effect for one use. This is like any other power stunt and the changed or additional descriptors are an important part of the stunt. Sometimes a power stunt may change nothing but an effect’s descriptor(s), such as changing a Damage effect from laser-light to a gamma-ray “graser” or from heat to cold. The GM decides what constitutes a reasonable change in descriptors for a power stunt, based on the power’s existing descriptors and effects."

Some devices are products of alien technology so advanced they might as well be magical, or focuses of psychic or cosmic power beyond the understanding of both magic and science. All devices work the same way in game terms, regardless of their origin or descriptors.",
						"Generally speaking, devices are powers with the Removable flaw applied to them (see Removable in Powers), meaning the power is external to the character. Take away the device, and the wielder loses the ability to use those powers. So if an armored hero loses access to his battlesuit, for example, he also loses access to the powers tied-up in it. The same is the case of a hero loses a cosmic ring, magic helmet, or alien artifact, which is why Removable is a flaw for those powers.",
						"Just like other powers, devices cost Character points (albeit reduced some by the Removable flaw). Characters who want to have and use a device on a regular basis have to pay Character points to have it, just like having any other power. The device becomes a part of the character’s abilities. If the device is lost, stolen, or destroyed, the character can replace it, given time, since the device is considered a permanent part of the character. Only a reallocation of the character’s Character points will change this, and Gamemasters should allow characters to reallocate Character points spent on a Removable power if it is somehow permanently lost.",
						"In other cases, characters may make temporary use of a device. Most devices are usable by anyone able to operate them, in which case characters may loan devices to each other, or may pick up and use someone else’s device (or even steal a device away from someone in order to use it against them). The key concept here is the use of the device is temporary, something that happens during a single scene or, at most, a single adventure. If the character wants to continue using the device beyond that, he must pay Character points to make the device part of his regular abilities. Otherwise the GM can simply rule that the device is lost, reclaimed by its owner, runs out of power, breaks down, or whatever, and is therefore no longer accessible. Characters with the Inventor and Artificer advantages can create temporary devices for use in an adventure.",

										"This game encourages this kind of narrative structure by awarding Victory points for defeats, capture, and similar complications suffered by the heroes. Essentially, the more the heroes struggle early on in the game, the more resources (in this case, Victory points) they have to overcome the villain later.",
										"Defeat in the comics isn’t a serious problem, since it usually just results in the heroes facing another obstacle, like a deathtrap, rather than ending the story. Some players, however, don’t care for the idea of defeat, even when there is some kind of reward for it. This may come from other RPGs, where defeat has much more serious consequences, up to and including the death of the heroes! It can also come from associating any kind of defeat or set-back with “losing the game.” These players may overreact to potential defeats in the game.",
										"The best way of handling this is to discuss it with your players. Point out that an early defeat by the villain is not necessarily a “loss,” but a complication, and that they earn Victory points for complications, leading up to the point where they can use their earned points against the villain. If this doesn’t address the issue, you may need to give the heroes complications other than defeats, at least at first. When you do have the heroes defeated as a complication, make sure the players all know that there is no chance for their heroes to avoid this once you spring it on them, to minimize the opportunity for them to struggle and rail hopelessly against it."

In a game, you may have to contend with players unwilling to let the villain go, so long as there’s any chance of snatching victory from the jaws of defeat. These players will try anything and everything before they give up, which can cause problems for the story and spoil the game for others.

The only exception is when you want the players to dislike the “guests” as much as possible! For example, if you have a story wherein mind-controlled heroes try to upstage the player characters, then go right ahead and have the NPCs steal their thunder. You can be sure the players won’t like them one bit!",

Have them be the ones defeated and captured by the villains, for example, and allow the player characters to rescue them (also dealing with the issue of captures, previously). Have NPCs come to the heroes for aid or advice. Retiring heroes can pass the torch to a younger generation, while younger, less experienced heroes can look to the player characters for inspiration and guidance.",
										"Another option is to allow the players to run the guest stars instead of, or in addition to, their regular characters. As long as you’re not upstaging the players, it’s okay to allow them to upstage their own characters! For example, you can allow the players to run members of another hero team, meeting their regular characters as NPCs, or you can have two teams band together, mixing and matching characters from each and having each player run a regular hero and a guest hero. This can be a great way to include various heroes as guest characters in your games."

If the aliens steal radioactive isotopes from a nuclear power plant, a fight might risk damaging the reactor, causing a meltdown (a possible complication). That’s a different encounter than if the aliens steal parts from a high-tech robotics factory, where the fight could involve a robot assembly line (which offers the characters big, heavy things to chuck at each other).",

The difficulty and number of challenges in the middle determines how long the story is, from a single quick game session to an entire series (with each challenge in the middle being an entire adventure of its own).",

If it’s an existing villain, they find out the villain’s current plan (and perhaps how the villain escaped from prison or survived certain death from a previous story). If it’s a disaster, they see the first signs and get expert advice on what’s likely to happen, and so forth.",

However, sooner or later, you’re going to want to raise the series power level, giving heroes a bit more room for advancement and spending their earned Character points.",
										"A good guideline is to follow the starting Character point totals when it comes to power level: When the heroes accumulate an additional 15 Character points from the start of the series or the last time the power level was raised, it’s probably time to consider raising the power level by one. So a power level 10 series starts out with 150-point heroes. When they have earned another 15 Character points (bringing their total up to 165), the GM should consider raising the series power level to 11, allowing the heroes to spend some of those points to increase traits currently at the maximum limit.",
										"When you increase the series power level, you should also reevaluate the capabilities of the villains and other challenges the heroes face. While NPCs don’t “earn” Character points, and aren’t even subject to the same power level limits as the heroes, you should feel free to improve the traits of non-player characters in the series to keep pace with the heroes, ensuring those antagonists remain a suitable challenge. It’s also fine to have others lag behind, as the heroes outstrip some of their old foes, who no longer represent the kind of threat they did before, plus you can always introduce new villains and challenges suited to the series power level as things progress.",
										"As the series progresses, you may want to slow the rate of increasing power level, stretching it out to even 20, 30, or more earned Character points. This allows opportunities for the players to further widen and deepen their heroes’ traits rather than focusing on a direct “upward” path of improvement. You may even choose to stop raising power level past a certain point. Some very experienced heroes may be as high as PL15, but have Character point totals well in excess of the recommended starting amount for that level.

Problem solving is a matter of either combat or clever thinking, and roleplaying is an opportunity for players to deliver moralistic speeches and clever catchphrases or exchange witty banter with the villains and each other.",
												"A light style is one where reality is largely what you make of it. Light stories tend to be full of fantastic characters and ideas. Heroes might face an alien invasion from another dimension one adventure and explore a lost world full of dinosaurs and cavemen the next. Realism isn’t as important as telling a fun and exciting story. On the other hand, the lighter comics were often inconsistent and sometimes veered off into the extremely fantastic or even silly.

The players have greater responsibility for deciding their characters’ actions and may have a greater impact on the world. Heroes are often faced with intense moral dilemmas and conflicts, such as supporting a corrupt government that provides order and stability against the rebels who would bring it down, or going outside the law to deal with vile criminals the justice system can’t reach.",
												"The dark style allows players considerable freedom, since the heroes could, and often do, use any means available to accomplish their goals. On the other hand, it’s often difficult to distinguish the heroes from the villains in this play style, since both use similar cynical or even bloodthirsty methods. The authorities are less likely to trust dark heroes, unless they happen to be working as a “black ops” or enforcement arm of a government agency. Even then there’s considerable distrust of anyone in a costume or displaying powers, since bystanders often take the brunt of conflict between the heroes and their opponents."

You may go for a mostly light style with a slightly modern “edge” to it, a dark style that doesn’t get quite so grim but holds on to some light values, tempered with realism and an air of danger, or any other combo you can imagine. Comics have experimented with a lot of different styles over the years and you can draw upon any of them for your own series, or create your own unique style.",
												"Whatever you choose, try to make the style of your series clear to the players so they know what to expect in advance and can create heroes suited to the game. A grim vigilante who kills opponents in cold blood may not be suited to a mostly light game. Likewise, a heroic “Boy Scout” may look ridiculous in a dark game of grim and gritty realism. If you feel a particular player’s concept isn’t suited for your game’s style, you’re better off telling the player in advance and asking for a different character than having trouble later on when it turns out the player isn’t enjoying the game."
