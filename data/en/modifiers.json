This cost does not include the cost of the Alternate Effect modifier itself. So if the 20-point power has 5 Alternate Effects (making the final cost 25 points), each Alternate Effect is still limited to a total value of 20 points (including any modifiers it may have), that of the base effect. Essentially, each Alternate Effect has to have all of the others as Alternate Effects. Since the modifier applies equally to all effects in the array, its cost is discounted in terms of the “free” points they have to spend.",

						"Arrays—collections of Alternate Effects—are one of the more complex and important constructs and require some special care in terms of their creation and use.

						"The main reason for the Alternate Effect modifier is to allow a degree of flexibility in terms of a character’s power effects within the cost restrictions laid down by having a finite number of character points. It’s based on the assumption that a wide range of powers has a diminishing return in terms of value, since characters can only use so many effects at once. A power with various “settings,” usable one at a time, is more valuable than a power with only one, but not as valuable as various effects all usable at the same time.",
						"However, Alternate Effect can be abused to try and squeeze the most “efficiency” out of a character’s character points, gaining the most effects for the lowest cost. The guidelines for Alternate Effects are intended to help limit this somewhat, but there is no way they can eliminate the possibility entirely and still provide all the benefits of flexibility they’re intended to offer. Some Gamemaster oversight is therefore necessary when it comes to the creation and use of arrays.",
						"Before giving a character Alternate Effects, it is wise to ask, “Is an array really needed for this concept?” Some concepts, such as a variety of different attacks, clearly call for an array. Others, like a power with a few rarely used stunts, may not call for an array. Such a power may be better served by acquiring such occasional stunts through {@rule extra effort|basic|1|extra effort} and the spending of victory points rather than the creation of a permanent set of Alternate Effects. That is what the power stunts rules are for, after all: so you do not have to fill up character sheets with minor Alternate Effects a hero will rarely ever use.",
						"If you decide an array is appropriate, the first thing is to determine its overall theme and associated descriptors. Is it an array of different attacks, like a “weapons array” of a battlesuit? Is it a collection of regular power stunts for a themed power like earth control, or spells for magic? Is it a series of alternate forms for a metamorph? And so forth. Arrays should have some unifying theme beyond “all the powers I want my hero to have,” and Gamemasters should feel free to veto inappropriate arrays lacking a strong theme."

				"When applied to an effect that doesn’t normally allow a resistance check, this flaw gives it one. Choose the defense when the flaw is applied. Since effects that work on others allow a resistance check by definition, this nearly always applies to personal effects that allow someone interacting with them to circumvent the effect with a successful check.",
				"For example, an Enhanced Parry defense effect might reflect a low-level reading of a target’s mind to anticipate and avoid attacks. It allows a Will resistance check to overcome the effect, denying you the defense bonus against that opponent (and applying this flaw to the effect). Likewise, your Concealment effect might be illusory rather than a true physical transformation, permitting a Will resistance check for someone to overcome it. A sustained Protection effect might be some sort of “kinetic field” that permits an attacker a Fortitude resistance check to overcome it.",
				"When applied to an effect that does normally allow a resistance check, this flaw gives it an additional one, which may be the same as its normal resistance, or different. The target makes both resistance checks and applies the better of the two to determine the effect’s result.",
				"For example, a Damage effect might involve whirling blades an attacker can avoid with a successful Dodge resistance check, circumventing the need for a Toughness check against the damage. Similarly a Weaken effect based on a poison dart might add a Toughness check to see if the dart penetrates the target’s skin in addition to making the usual Fortitude check against the effect."

Success means the target has managed to avert his eyes, cover his ears, etc. and the effect doesn’t work. Otherwise the effect works normally and the target makes the usual resistance check against it, if any.",
				"Opponents aware of a Sense-Dependent effect can also deliberately block the targeted sense: looking away, covering or blocking their ears, etc. This provides a +10 bonus to resistance checks against the effect, but gives others partial concealment from that sense. An opponent unable to use a sense (blind, deaf, etc.) is immune to effects dependent on it. Opponents can do this by closing their eyes, wearing ear- or nose-plugs, or using another effect like Concealment. This gives you total concealment from that sense.",

				"The exact nature of the side effect is for you and the Gamemaster to determine. As a general guideline, it should be an effect about the same in value as the effect with this flaw. So an effect with a cost of 20 points should have a 20-point side effect. Typical side effects include Affliction, Damage, or Weaken, or the base effect itself (it essentially rebounds and affects you instead). The Side Effect does not require an attack check and only affects you, although the GM may permit some Side Effects with the Area modifier on a case-by-case basis. You get a normal resistance check against the Side Effect. If you are immune to your own powers, you aren’t immune to its side-effect.",

In essence, the power requires extra effort in order to use it (see Extra Effort). This makes Tiring a useful flaw for creating an effect you can only use with extra effort.",
				"Tiring is often applied to just some ranks of an effect to represent a higher level of the effect, usable only through extra effort. For example, a hero might have a rank 12 Damage effect, but routinely use only 8 ranks of it. The remaining 4 ranks are Tiring, so using them quickly fatigues the hero.",
