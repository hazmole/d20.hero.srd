Similarly, the mass, distance, or time affected by various other traits, especially powers, is determined on the Measurements Table.",

So a normal person can cover 2 miles in an hour (time 9 + speed 0 = 9, the rank for 2 miles). In fact, with normal human speeds, you can just directly compare the time and distance columns of the table! As another example, a hero with Flight 12 can cover 8,000 miles in an hour! That’s 12 (speed) + 9 (time) = 21, the rank for 8,000 miles. The same character can go an amazing 16 miles in just 6 seconds (the time of one action round)!",

So if you’re looking for a measurement that’s not on the table, pick the next highest one that is; so 12 hours is a time rank of 13 (more than 8 hours, but less than 16), and 6 miles is a distance rank of 11 (more than 4 miles, but less than 8).",
										"{@b Like abilities, measures can have negative ranks.} In the time rank example, the time it takes a Speed 14 hero to cover 30 miles is rank –1, or 3 seconds. You can extend the negative side the Measurement Table just like you can the positive side, with each lower rank halving the previous measurement. So rank –6 is half a pound, 1/16th of a second, and 3 inches, for example.",
										"{@b Don’t directly add ranks.} Putting rank 4 distance together with rank 6 distance is not rank 10 distance! Rank 4 is a distance measurement of 500 feet. Rank 6 is 600 yards (1,800 feet). Adding the measurements, you get about 2,300 feet. If you directly added the ranks, you’d get rank 10 distance, or 4 miles! If you have different ranks, it is best to either handle them separately or convert them to measurements, add the measurements together, and convert them back to a rank. In the previous example, 2,300 feet is rank 7 distance (around half a mile).",
										"{@b Measurements are approximate.} Especially at the higher end, where each rank represents a wide range of measurements, the Measurements Table isn’t intended to provide precise values; it’s just a ballpark estimate so you have an idea of how things work in the context of the game. Don’t focus too heavily on precise answers, just use the table for general guidelines."

This is one of the ways the Gamemaster’s judgment and intervention is important in the flow of the game.",
										"“…swing over to the catwalk …” This part of the action is a bit of a judgment call. If your hero has the Swinging movement effect (see {@b Powers}), then this is automatic. Otherwise, it might call for an Acrobatics skill check to pull it off; even then, if your hero is good enough at Acrobatics, the Gamemaster might call this a routine check and waive the need for a roll (see {@b Routine Checks}).",
										"“…kick the bad guy out of the way …” Here’s the real crux of the hero’s action. You want to hit the villain who, naturally, wants to avoid being hit. This calls for a check of your hero’s Fighting ability (which Measures the ability to hit things close-up). If you decided to have your hero shoot or throw something at the villain that would be a check of Dexterity instead.",
										"“…flip the switch back up …” Assuming the bad guy is out of the way, this is easy, no check required. If the hero’s attempt to hit the villain fails, then the hero still has to get past him in order to do this at all. So it all depends on the outcome of the Fighting check against the bad guy. If the mechanism was especially complex, the GM might ask for a check here, such as using the Technology skill to figure out how it works."
