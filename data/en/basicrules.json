Similarly, the mass, distance, or time affected by various other traits, especially powers, is determined on the Measurements Table.",

So a normal person can cover 2 miles in an hour (time 9 + speed 0 = 9, the rank for 2 miles). In fact, with normal human speeds, you can just directly compare the time and distance columns of the table! As another example, a hero with Flight 12 can cover 8,000 miles in an hour! That’s 12 (speed) + 9 (time) = 21, the rank for 8,000 miles. The same character can go an amazing 16 miles in just 6 seconds (the time of one action round)!",

										"{@b Each rank represents a range of measures.} Time rank 4 is actually all measures between 1 and 2 minutes, and time rank 16 is everything between 2 and 4 days! So if you’re looking for a measurement that’s not on the table, pick the next highest one that is; so 12 hours is a time rank of 13 (more than 8 hours, but less than 16), and 6 miles is a distance rank of 11 (more than 4 miles, but less than 8).",
										"{@b Like abilities, measures can have negative ranks.} In the time rank example, the time it takes a Speed 14 hero to cover 30 miles is rank –1, or 3 seconds. You can extend the negative side the Measurement Table just like you can the positive side, with each lower rank halving the previous measurement. So rank –6 is half a pound, 1/16th of a second, and 3 inches, for example.",
										"{@b Don’t directly add ranks.} Putting rank 4 distance together with rank 6 distance is not rank 10 distance! Rank 4 is a distance measurement of 500 feet. Rank 6 is 600 yards (1,800 feet). Adding the measurements, you get about 2,300 feet. If you directly added the ranks, you’d get rank 10 distance, or 4 miles! If you have different ranks, it is best to either handle them separately or convert them to measurements, add the measurements together, and convert them back to a rank. In the previous example, 2,300 feet is rank 7 distance (around half a mile).",
										"{@b Measurements are approximate.} Especially at the higher end, where each rank represents a wide range of measurements, the Measurements Table isn’t intended to provide precise values; it’s just a ballpark estimate so you have an idea of how things work in the context of the game. Don’t focus too heavily on precise answers, just use the table for general guidelines."

Several comic book heroes have struggled with various addictions and the effects on their lives.",
										"{@b Disability}: You are limited by a particular disability, such as being blind, deaf, or paraplegic. When your disability places serious challenges in your path, your complication comes into play. Many “disabled” heroes have powers or other compensations for their disabilities, such as a blind hero with other enhanced senses or a paraplegic who is a powerful psychic with matchless mobility of mind over body. Even though their powers sometime make up for their disability, this complication is still appropriate because they may have to deal with it from time to time.",
										"{@b Enemy}: You have an enemy, or enemies, trying to do you harm. The GM can have your enemy show up to cause you trouble, and adventures involving your enemy tend to be more complicated for you; even personal grudge-matches, if the enmity goes both ways. When having an enemy causes a particular problem for you (such as your enemy abducting a loved one or laying a trap for you), you get a victory point.",
										"{@b Fame}: You’re a public figure, known almost everywhere you go, hounded by the media, swamped by fans and well-wishers, and similar problems, which create various complications.",
										"{@b Hatred}: You have an irrational hatred of something, leading you to actively oppose the object of your dislike in some way, no matter the consequences. Complications involving your hatred tend to overwhelm your better judgment.",
										"{@b Honor}: You have a strong personal code of honor. Generally this means you won’t take unfair advantage of opponents or use trickery, but you can define the exact terms of your code with the GM. Your honor becomes a complication when it puts you in a bind or on the horns of a moral dilemma.",
										"{@b Identity}: Heroes often maintain secret identities, creating various complications as they try to keep them secret from friends and enemies alike. The dual-identity can even go beyond mere disguise for heroes who actually transform into a different persona, creating complications around controlling that transformation, or a lack of powers or abilities in one persona.",
										"{@b Obsession}: You’re obsessed with a particular subject and pursue it to the exclusion of all else, which can create quite a few complications.",
										"{@b Phobia}: You’re irrationally afraid of something. When confronted with it you have to fight to control your fear, causing you to hesitate, flee, or act irrationally.",
										"{@b Power Loss}: Certain circumstances cause some or all of your powers to fail or stop working, or rob you of them altogether. You might depend on particular objects others can steal or take from you, or lose your powers during the dark of the moon, or when exposed to exotic radiation. You may even simply lose faith in yourself, resulting in temporary weakness. When this happens, and poses a challenge for you, your complication comes into play.",
										"{@b Prejudice}: You are part of a minority group subject to the prejudices of others, which create problems. Similarly, characters with unusual origins or appearance might face prejudice, such as a demonic-looking hero who is considered suspect. Some Gamemasters and gaming groups may prefer not to deal with issues of prejudice in their games, in which case the GM is free to ban this complication.",
										"{@b Quirk}: Complications can often come from various personality quirks: likes, dislikes, hobbies, neuroses, and so forth. For example, a hero might have the quirk of always leaving some sort of “calling card” for the authorities along with a captured criminal. That could become a complication if somebody else starts imitating it, or uses it to cause trouble for the hero.",
										"{@b Relationship}: The important people in a hero’s life are a source of strength, but they can also complicate matters considerably. If they are not in on the hero’s costumed identity, then there is juggling two lives and keeping loved ones safely in the dark. On the other hand, if the people in a hero’s life do know the truth, they are in danger from the hero’s foes and others seeking to find out.",
										"{@b Reputation}: You have a bad reputation, affecting what others think of you (whether you deserve it or not). Having someone adopt a bad attitude toward you because of your reputation is a complication. You might struggle to overcome your reputation, taking chances or facing difficulties others do not as a result.",
										"{@b Responsibility}: You have various demands on your time and attention. Responsibilities include family obligations, professional duties, and similar things. Failing to live up to your responsibilities can mean loss of relationships, employment, and other problems.",
										"{@b Rivalry}: You feel a strong sense of competition with a person or group and have to do your best to outdo your rival at every opportunity.",
										"{@b Secret}: You have something potentially damaging or embarrassing you’re hiding from the world. The most common secret for heroes is their true identity, but it could be a secret weakness (another complication) or some dark secret from your past. Occasionally, something (or someone) may threaten to reveal your secret.",
										"{@b Temper}: Certain things just set you off. When you lose your temper you lash out at whatever provoked you.",
										"{@b Weakness}: Some things can hurt you, badly. You might have a weakness that overcomes your normally strong defenses, like a werewolf is vulnerable to silver, or you may suffer harm from things that are harmless to others, from water to cold iron or exotic energies or materials. A weakness may add degrees of effect or impose an entirely different effect. {@effect Affliction} is the typical effect, but some weaknesses inflict outright {@effect Damage}, {@effect Weaken} the target, or have some other effect. You and the GM can discuss common effects beforehand and it is up to the GM to decide what happens when the particular weakness comes into play. When the GM uses your weakness against you, it’s a complication."

								"The problem with such “up-front” rewards for giving a character flaws is that the player gets all of the reward (the bonus design points) immediately, but the disadvantage only occasionally limits or affects the character, sometimes even randomly. Since there is only so much “screen time” in a game session, there is virtually no way for the GM to spotlight every one of every character’s disadvantages, so some end up being worth “more” in the sense of reward in exchange for drawbacks. Plus, after they have “paid out” their initial benefit, front-loaded negative traits are nothing but a burden to the character from that point forward, leading players to try and avoid or mitigate them as much as possible.",
								"Complications address this issue by having a “pay-as-you-go” approach: if the GM uses a complication in the game, and the player responds by going along with it, the player gets a reward in the form of a victory point. This means that although the hero has to deal with some “bad stuff” from time to time, there is an upside, and a reason for players to want their characters’ complications to come into play!

								{
									"type": "list",
									"items": [
										"{@b Accident}: Perhaps the most common origin. The hero gains powers accidentally from exposure to some force like radiation, chemicals, unleashed mystic energies, being struck by lightning, and so forth. Accidents are often one-time events, although sometimes there is an effort to recreate an accident to deliberately make super-beings. The current science of the setting tends to influence accidental origins. Golden Age heroes in the 1940s often gained their powers from chemical accidents while Silver Age heroes in the Atomic Age of the ‘60s got their powers from radiation and modern heroes acquire powers from accidents involving genetic engineering, nanotech, and similar cutting-edge technologies.",
										"{@b Alien}: A hero may be a member of an alien race with unusual powers compared to humans. Either all members of the race have similar powers or particular conditions (lighter gravity, solar radiation, etc.) grant them powers while on Earth. Some “alien” races in the comics are actually super-human offshoots of humanity living isolated from the rest of the world. “Aliens” also include mystical beings from other dimensions, from angels and demons to elementals and actual gods, as well as mortal half-breeds descended from them. An alien hero’s powers might even have another origin; being an alien only explains part of the character’s powers or is merely a background element.",
										"{@b Endowment}: Some outside force grants the hero powers. This might be an experimental procedure, a godlike higher power, a secret organization that hands out powerful devices, a mysterious wizard, or something similar. The patron might expect something in return from the hero for this boon, or the gift could be unconditional.",
										"{@b Experiment}: Some heroes gain powers from a deliberate effort, such as a scientific or mystical technique for transforming someone into a super-being. Like accidents, experiments are often impossible to duplicate. The hero may be a willing volunteer or a victim chosen to test out the technique. Some heroes create their own powers, either developing the power-granting procedure or building their own devices.",
										"{@b Mutant}: A hero may simply be born “different,” with the genetic potential for super-powers. These latent powers typically emerge in a time of stress, especially the changes brought on by puberty, although they might also appear as a result of an accident (combining the accident and mutant origins).",
										"{@b Training}: Finally, some heroes acquire powers through hard work and training, whether physical discipline, studying esoteric martial arts techniques, meditation and introspection to unlock hidden mental powers, or mastering the arts of magic. Such training is typically arduous and not everyone has what it takes to accomplish it. Heroes who gained their powers through training may have rivals or foes who trained with them (see Enemy and Rivalry complications)."

However, sooner or later, you’re going to want to raise the power level, giving the heroes a bit more breathing room for advancement and spending their earned Character points.",
								"A good guideline is to follow the starting Character point totals when it comes to power level: when the heroes accumulate an additional 15 Character points from the start of the series or the last time the power level was raised, it’s probably time to raise the power level by +1. So a power level 10 game starts out with 150-point heroes.

While NPCs don’t earn additional Character points as such, and aren’t even subject to the same power level limits as the heroes, you should feel free to improve the traits of some non-player characters to keep pace with the heroes, ensuring those antagonists remain a suitable challenge.

								"A power’s descriptors are primarily for color. It’s more interesting and clear to say a hero has a “Flame Blast” or “Lightning Bolt” power than a generic “Damage effect.” “Flame” and “lightning” are descriptors for the Damage effect. Descriptors do have some impact on the game since some effects work only on or with effects of a particular descriptor. A hero may be immune to fire and heat, for example, so any effect with the “fire” or “heat” descriptor doesn’t affect that character. The different sense types are descriptors pertaining to sensory effects.",
								"Generally speaking, a descriptor is part of what a power is called beyond its game system name. For example, a weather-controlling heroine has the following effects: {@effect Damage}, {@effect Concealment}, and {@effect Environment}. Her Damage effect is the power to throw lightning bolts, so it has the descriptor “lightning.” If a villain can absorb electricity, then his power works against the heroine’s Damage (since lightning is electrical in nature). Concealment creates thick banks of fog, giving it the “fog” or “mist” descriptor. So if an opponent transforms into mist, with the ability to regenerate in clouds or fog, he can regenerate inside the heroine’s Concealment area. Her Environment is the power to control the weather, giving it the descriptor “weather.” If the heroine’s power comes as a gift from the gods, it may also have the descriptor “divine” or “magical.” On the other hand, if it comes from her mutant genetic structure, then it has the descriptor “mutant.” A villain able to nullify mutant powers could potentially nullify all of the heroine’s powers!",
								"The number of power descriptors is virtually limitless. The players and Gamemaster should cooperate to apply the appropriate descriptors to characters’ powers and use common sense when dealing with how the different descriptors interact. Just because one hero throws “lightning” and an opponent can absorb “electricity” doesn’t mean the villain’s absorption doesn’t work because it’s not the exact same descriptor. Lightning is a form of electricity. A certain amount of flexibility is built into descriptors, allowing them to cover the full range of possible powers. As in all things, the GM is the final arbitrator and should be consistent when ruling on whether or not a particular descriptor is appropriate and how all effects and descriptors interact in the series.",

												"{@b Invented} powers are designed and created by someone, either the inventor of a particular piece of technology or the designer of a technique or technology for bestowing powers on others.",
												"{@b Mutant} powers are inborn, but not natural to the character’s race or species. They are the result of a genetic quirk or mutation of some sort, possibly due to environmental influences like chemical mutagens or radiation. Since they involve a change in the subject’s DNA, mutant powers—or at least the potential for them—are inheritable.",

												"{@b Divine} powers come from a higher being, essentially a god or gods. Divine power is generally limited to the god(s) areas of influence and may be morally aligned, available only to wielders with an allegiance to that divinity.",
												"{@b Extradimensional} powers originate outside the home dimension of the setting, from other planes or dimensions of existence. Some extradimensional powers are scientific while others are downright mystical, or even beyond into realms “man was not meant to know.”",

Whether or not the moral power is aware and capable of interaction is up to the GM and the specifications of the setting; it’s the character’s belief in that ideal that matters so far as the power is concerned. “Good” and “evil” are common abstract moral sources of powers, but others may include chaos, law, an-archy, order, justice, balance, neutrality, reason, and so forth.",
												"{@b Psionic} powers are powers of the mind, coming from the psyche of the wielder (or perhaps from the Collective Unconscious, which acts as a “wellspring” of psionic power). This power source is associated with classic “mental” powers like telepathy and telekinesis, although effects like {@effect Mind Reading} and {@effect Move Object} can also come from other sources.",
												"{@b Technological} powers are the result of technology, machines and technological devices.

Is it glowing bonds of energy, sudden fever and dizziness, a curse of misfortune, a life-sapping vapor, or any number of other things?",

Some powers may not have or need result descriptors; after all, “{@effect Mind Control}” is a pretty clear description of a result. However, “an induced trance where the human brain becomes capable of accepting neurolinguistic programming inputs” is also a valid descriptor for that same effect.",

								"Generally, you should feel free to apply whatever descriptors seem appropriate and necessary to describe your character’s powers, so long as they don’t significantly change how they work in game terms.

The GM awards the player a victory point for the unexpected set-back and now the source of the heroine’s powers is known, although their origin still remains a mystery….",
										"Applying descriptors in play gives you a lot of flexibility, letting you handle certain things “on the fly” rather than having to describe every aspect of a character in excruciating detail beforehand. The key tool for handling the application of descriptors in play is the use of victory points. If applying a new descriptor is a setback for the hero, then award the player a victory point, just like any other setback (see {@rule Complications|basic|2|complications}). If the new descriptor is chosen by the player and gives the hero a minor advantage, you might ask the player to pay a victory point for the privilege, although you can balance this with an immediate victory point award for the clever idea, if you want (making the victory point a token expenditure).

In the latter case you might want to call for a {@skill Technology} skill check to make sure the character gets the terminals and the voltage right, but most of the time it’s better to just let the trick go through and give the character a chance to shine.",
										"Creative uses of descriptors with no real game effect are freebies: no extra effort or victory points needed. Situations where creative uses of descriptors have a significant game effect can be handled as power stunts: pick the effect that best suits the desired outcome and treat it as an {@modifier Alternate Effect} of the power the hero wants to use, with descriptors assigned as appropriate. If an electrical-controlling hero wants to use his power like a living defibrillator to save a heart-attack victim, for example, that can be a {@effect Healing} power stunt.

So long as the change doesn’t contradict any previously introduced information, this is no different than applying a descriptor in play, and should be handled in the same way. On the other hand, if other effects previously worked on the hero as if his powers were magical, then some sort of explanation is required. The Gamemaster may wish to limit or ban “discovering” a descriptor that has already been established, although it might still be changed.",
										"Changing descriptors is best handled as a plot device, much like reallocating character points and redesigning characters. If exposure to strange magical forces changes a character’s power source from biological to magical, for example, that’s something for the GM to decide in the context of the game. Like with defining descriptors in play, if a change in descriptors through GM Fiat constitutes a setback, the GM should award the player a victory point. Changes that provide an advantage don’t cost a victory point, however, since the GM chooses when and where they occur.",
										"Temporarily changing a descriptor can be a use of extra effort, like any other power stunt. For example, a hero might change the result of an electrical Damage effect to a magnetic Move Object effect for one use. This is like any other power stunt and the changed or additional descriptors are an important part of the stunt. Sometimes a power stunt may change nothing but an effect’s descriptor(s), such as changing a Damage effect from laser-light to a gamma-ray “graser” or from heat to cold.

Some players, however, don’t care for the idea of defeat, even when there is some kind of reward for it. This may come from other RPGs, where defeat has much more serious consequences, up to and including the death of the heroes! It can also come from associating any kind of defeat or set-back with “losing the game.” These players may overreact to potential defeats in the game.",

Point out that an early defeat by the villain is not necessarily a “loss,” but a complication, and that they earn Victory points for complications, leading up to the point where they can use their earned points against the villain. If this doesn’t address the issue, you may need to give the heroes complications other than defeats, at least at first. When you do have the heroes defeated as a complication, make sure the players all know that there is no chance for their heroes to avoid this once you spring it on them, to minimize the opportunity for them to struggle and rail hopelessly against it."

However, sooner or later, you’re going to want to raise the series power level, giving heroes a bit more room for advancement and spending their earned Character points.",
										"A good guideline is to follow the starting Character point totals when it comes to power level: When the heroes accumulate an additional 15 Character points from the start of the series or the last time the power level was raised, it’s probably time to consider raising the power level by one. So a power level 10 series starts out with 150-point heroes. When they have earned another 15 Character points (bringing their total up to 165), the GM should consider raising the series power level to 11, allowing the heroes to spend some of those points to increase traits currently at the maximum limit.",
										"When you increase the series power level, you should also reevaluate the capabilities of the villains and other challenges the heroes face. While NPCs don’t “earn” Character points, and aren’t even subject to the same power level limits as the heroes, you should feel free to improve the traits of non-player characters in the series to keep pace with the heroes, ensuring those antagonists remain a suitable challenge. It’s also fine to have others lag behind, as the heroes outstrip some of their old foes, who no longer represent the kind of threat they did before, plus you can always introduce new villains and challenges suited to the series power level as things progress.",
										"As the series progresses, you may want to slow the rate of increasing power level, stretching it out to even 20, 30, or more earned Character points. This allows opportunities for the players to further widen and deepen their heroes’ traits rather than focusing on a direct “upward” path of improvement. You may even choose to stop raising power level past a certain point. Some very experienced heroes may be as high as PL15, but have Character point totals well in excess of the recommended starting amount for that level.

Heroes are often faced with intense moral dilemmas and conflicts, such as supporting a corrupt government that provides order and stability against the rebels who would bring it down, or going outside the law to deal with vile criminals the justice system can’t reach.",
												"The dark style allows players considerable freedom, since the heroes could, and often do, use any means available to accomplish their goals. On the other hand, it’s often difficult to distinguish the heroes from the villains in this play style, since both use similar cynical or even bloodthirsty methods. The authorities are less likely to trust dark heroes, unless they happen to be working as a “black ops” or enforcement arm of a government agency. Even then there’s considerable distrust of anyone in a costume or displaying powers, since bystanders often take the brunt of conflict between the heroes and their opponents."
